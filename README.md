# Data-Journalism
Hello! I'm Siqi Ji, a young journalist based in Hong Kong, and I'm really passionate about computational journalism and data! 

I went to Columbia Journalism School in 2019, and started to learn about data and [computational journalism](https://github.com/computationaljournalism/columbia2020/tree/master/notebooks). My professors are very experienced data journalist who have worked for prestigious media outlets including The New York Times.

This is the space where I upload my data journalism projects or practices, including code and data files.
